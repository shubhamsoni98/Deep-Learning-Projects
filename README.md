# Deep-Learning-Projects
This project predicts the burned area of forest fires using historical data and weather reports. It employs a neural network model built with TensorFlow, utilizing data preprocessing with Scikit-learn and analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib. The goal is to provide accurate, real-time predictions to aid in fire management and prevention.
