# Forest Fire Prediction Using Neural Networks

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to predict the burned area of forest fires using historical data and weather reports. Accurate predictions can help in better resource allocation and preventive measures to mitigate fire damage.

## About the Project
This project employs Data Science and Machine Learning techniques to build a predictive model that utilizes historical fire data and relevant weather conditions. The model aims to identify patterns that can inform future fire occurrences and their potential impact.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Collection
- A dataset containing historical instances of forest fires, including information on burned areas and corresponding weather conditions.

### 2. Data Pre-processing
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for data normalization and preprocessing to ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis.

### 3. Data Handling
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: Employed for reading CSV files, data manipulation, and numerical computations.
- Data cleaning processes handle missing values, outliers, and irrelevant features.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for data visualization to identify trends and correlations in the dataset.

### 4. Model Development
- **TensorFlow**: Leveraged for developing neural network models. The model architecture is designed to learn from the processed data and predict the burned area based on weather inputs.
- The neural network is trained using historical data, optimizing parameters to improve accuracy.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Performance of the model is assessed using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, RÂ² score) to ensure reliability in predictions.

### 6. Deployment
- Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed for real-time predictions, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions.
