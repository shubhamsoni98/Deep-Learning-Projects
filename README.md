# Forest Fire Prediction Using Neural Networks

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to predict the burned area of forest fires using historical data and weather reports. Accurate predictions can help in better resource allocation and preventive measures to mitigate fire damage.

## About the Project
This project employs Data Science and Machine Learning techniques to build a predictive model that utilizes historical fire data and relevant weather conditions. The model aims to identify patterns that can inform future fire occurrences and their potential impact.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Collection
- A dataset containing historical instances of forest fires, including information on burned areas and corresponding weather conditions.

### 2. Data Pre-processing
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for data normalization and preprocessing to ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis.

### 3. Data Handling
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: Employed for reading CSV files, data manipulation, and numerical computations.
- Data cleaning processes handle missing values, outliers, and irrelevant features.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for data visualization to identify trends and correlations in the dataset.

### 4. Model Development
- **TensorFlow**: Leveraged for developing neural network models. The model architecture is designed to learn from the processed data and predict the burned area based on weather inputs.
- The neural network is trained using historical data, optimizing parameters to improve accuracy.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Performance of the model is assessed using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R² score) to ensure reliability in predictions.

### 6. Deployment
- Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed for real-time predictions, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions.

# Prediction-of-turbine-energy-yield-TEY
Prediction of turbine energy yield (TEY) using Neural Networks

## Problem Statement:
Prediction of turbine energy yield (TEY) using ambient variables and Turbine parameters as features

## Project Overview:
Gas turbines are essential in many industrial applications, particularly for electricity generation. Monitoring and predicting their performance is crucial for optimizing efficiency and reducing emissions. In this project, a neural network model is developed to predict gas turbine energy yield and emissions from operational sensor data.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this project consists of sensor measurements from a gas turbine, recorded under various operating conditions. The variables include ambient factors like temperature, pressure, and humidity and turbine-specific readings such as exhaust pressure and turbine temperatures. The dataset contains 36733 instances of 11 sensor measures aggregated over one hour (utilizing average or sum) from a gas turbine. The Dataset includes gas turbine parameters (such as Turbine Inlet Temperature and Compressor Discharge pressure).

## Variables:
1. Ambient temperature (AT): The temperature around the turbine (in °C).
2. Ambient pressure (AP): The pressure of the surrounding air (in mbar).
3. Ambient humidity (AH): The relative humidity of the surrounding air (in %).
4. Air filter difference pressure (AFDP): The pressure difference across the turbine's air filter (in mbar).
5. Gas turbine exhaust pressure (GTEP): The pressure at the turbine's exhaust (in mbar).
6. Turbine inlet temperature (TIT): The temperature at the turbine's inlet (in °C).
7. Turbine after temperature (TAT): The temperature after the turbine (in °C).
8. Compressor discharge pressure (CDP): The pressure at the compressor discharge (in mbar).
9. Turbine energy yield (TEY): The energy generated by the turbine (in MWH).
10. Carbon monoxide (CO): The concentration of CO emissions (in mg/m³).
11. Nitrogen oxides (NOx): The concentration of NOx emissions (in mg/m³).


## Key Technologies:
**1. Python**: Core programming language for data processing and model building.

**2. TensorFlow/Keras**: For neural network model development.

**3. NumPy/Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

**4. Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
